# cloudflare-ddns
A python script to update cloudflare DNS to provide dynamic DNS.

# Usage
Make a copy of `example_config.py` named `config.py` and fill in your details.
Then just run `python3 ddns.py`.
For final deployments I would recommend setting up a `cron` job to run the script every so often.
